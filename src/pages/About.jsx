        <p>
          I am a university student passionate about web development. I am
          currently learning React to build modern, interactive user interfaces.
          This portfolio showcases my progress and projects as I continue to grow
          as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to master React and apply it to create useful applications
          that solve real-world problems. I enjoy experimenting with new
          technologies and improving my coding skills every day.
